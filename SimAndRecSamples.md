# Simulation and Reconstruction samples

### The information of samples on this side.
* [MC database on github](docs/index.html)

### Additional DBD samples
* According to the requests by the physics group, additional physics samples have been produced
using the software used for DBD study (ILCSoft-v01-16-xx).  The information of them will be found 
at [https://confluence.desy.de/display/ILD/Monte+Carlo+Production](https://confluence.desy.de/display/ILD/Monte+Carlo+Production)

### Links to the old samples
* [DBD 2012 simulation and reconstruction samples](http://ilcsoft.desy.de/dbd/status/index.html)  
  1000 GeV and 500 GeV samples used for DBD ( ILC TDR ) studies.  
* [Snowmass 2013 samples](http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~miyamoto/CDS/prod_status/)  
  250 GeV, 350 GeV and some 500 GeV samples for snowmass studies.
