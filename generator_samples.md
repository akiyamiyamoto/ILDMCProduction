* Revised 500 GeV 6f samples: In order to remove douple countings in diagrams among 500 GeV 6f processes, they were re-generated by Tino and Junping. The information of them will be found [here](http://www-jlc.kek.jp/~tianjp/6f_whizard/README.txt)

### Samples for calibration
### uds samples  
- **DIRAC LFN:/ilc/mc-2008/generated/ucam_uds/**  
  Energy: 91GeV, 200GeV, 360GeV, 500GeV  
  These samples were generated at the time of LOI study by M.Thomson. The original URL,  http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/stdhep/, is not accessible now.
  Copies of them will be found at following local paths;  
  KEK : /group/ilc/soft/samples/gen/MThomson/   
  DESY: /pnfs/desy.de/ilc/mc-2008/generated/ucam_uds/  
     
- **DIRAC LFN:/ilc/user/s/sgreen/StdHepFiles/Z_uds/**  
  Energy: 67 energy points from 30GeV to 3000GeV  
  They were generated by Steve Green.  Copies of them will be found at following local paths;  
  KEK: /hsm/ilc/grid/storm/user/s/sgreen/StdHepFiles/Z_uds/  
  DESY:/pnfs/desy.de/ilc/user/s/sgreen/StdHepFiles/Z_uds/  
    
#### Single particle samples
- **DIRAC LFN:/ilc/user/a/amiyamot/mygen/single_particles/jeans/**  
  Single particle events of muon, photon, and k0L for momentum from 1 to 100 GeV,
in lcio format.  A script to these generate samples is [lcio_particle_gun.py](gen/lcio_particle_gun.py)
